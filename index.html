            <h2>Paladin</h2>
            <p>Paladin is one of the tank class that you can play and it is by far the best tank in terms of handling mitigation and highest defense stats at the moment.<br> In regards to tanking, it is the easiest class to play due to the amount of defensive buff skills you get from paladin as a whole for their kit. If you are <br>wondering if paladin do good damage as well, you're wrong; they have the worst damage output by far in terms of ranking out of all the other tank classes <br>so it offsets based on how you want to play as a tank. </p>
